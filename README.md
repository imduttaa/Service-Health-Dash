# Service Health Dashboard

A real-time observability platform for monitoring microservice health and performance.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice | Rationale |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| BFF | Fastify 4 + TypeScript | Schema-first, ~2× faster than Express, built-in WebSocket plugin |
| Real-time | WebSocket (`ws`) | Bidirectional, clean reconnect semantics, universal browser support |
| Client state | Zustand 4 | Zero-boilerplate, atomic selectors prevent cascade re-renders |
| Server state | TanStack Query 5 | Caching, pagination, optimistic mutations, deduplication |
| Charts | Recharts 2 | React-native composable API, no canvas imperative mess |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS 3 | Utility-first, zero-runtime, dark mode via `class` strategy |
| Routing/URL | React Router 6 | URL-driven state with `useSearchParams` |
| Monorepo | npm workspaces | Shared types between server and client without a build step |

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+

## Getting Started

### 1. Install all dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start both server and client in development mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

This launches:
- **BFF server** → `http://localhost:3001`
- **Vite dev server** → `http://localhost:5173`

The Vite dev server proxies `/api` requests to the BFF, so you only need to open `http://localhost:5173`.

### 3. Open the dashboard

Navigate to **http://localhost:5173** in your browser.

## Running Server and Client Separately

```bash
# Terminal 1 — BFF
npm run dev --workspace=server

# Terminal 2 — Client
npm run dev --workspace=client
```

## Key Features

### Real-time Stream
- WebSocket connection with automatic exponential-backoff reconnection
- RAF-batched metric updates — all 20 service updates per tick flushed in one animation frame
- Reconnect banner shows connection state; panels degrade gracefully with stale data

### URL-Driven State
All shareable state is encoded in the URL:
```
/?service=api-gateway&range=1h&status=open&severity=critical&page=2
```
Refreshing or sharing the URL restores the exact view.

### Feature Flags

Flags are controlled through three mechanisms (highest priority wins):

| Priority | Method | How |
|----------|--------|-----|
| 1 (highest) | Runtime — in-app panel or API | Gear icon in the Navbar, or `PATCH /api/flags` |
| 2 | Environment variables | `FEATURE_ENABLE_METRICS_PANEL=false` at process start |
| 3 (lowest) | `server/flags.json` | Edit and commit; loaded on startup |

Runtime `PATCH` changes persist to `flags.json` automatically, so toggled flags survive a server restart.

```bash
# Toggle a flag via curl
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:3001/api/flags \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"enable-dependency-map": false}'
```

The `MetricsPanel` and `DependencyMap` flags are evaluated **independently** — disabling one does not affect the other. Each panel lives or dies on its own flag.

### Data Export

- **Charts → PNG** — download button in the MetricsPanel header captures all three charts (Response Time, Error Rate, Request Rate) at 2× resolution including legends
- **Alerts → CSV** — CSV button in the Alerts panel header exports all records matching the current filters (not just the current page), UTF-8 with BOM for direct Excel compatibility

### Dark Mode
Theme toggle in the Navbar with system preference detection (`prefers-color-scheme`). Preference is persisted in `localStorage` so it survives a page reload. Implemented via `ThemeContext` + Tailwind's `class` dark mode strategy — no runtime CSS-in-JS overhead.

### Dependency Map
SVG-based service dependency graph (no external graph library — raw SVG keeps the bundle lean). Uses a deterministic column-per-group layout. Degraded and down dependency paths are highlighted with amber dashed edges. Includes an inline legend, fits its container width responsively, and supports fullscreen mode.

### Error Isolation
Each panel is wrapped in a `PanelErrorBoundary`. A crash in the MetricsPanel doesn't affect the AlertsTable.

## Bonus Features Implemented

The following optional bonus features from the assignment are fully implemented:

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Dependency Map** | SVG node graph showing inter-service dependencies. Degraded/down paths highlighted with amber dashed edges. Responsive (scales to container width), fullscreen toggle, inline legend. |
| **Dark Mode** | Navbar theme toggle with `prefers-color-scheme` system detection. Persisted in `localStorage`. Zero runtime overhead via Tailwind `class` strategy. |
| **Data Export** | Charts → PNG at 2× resolution via `html2canvas` (all three charts captured in one file). Alerts → CSV with UTF-8 BOM for direct Excel compatibility; exports all rows matching current filters, not just the visible page. |
| **End-to-End Type Safety** | `@healthdash/shared` npm workspace package shared by both server and client. `Service`, `Alert`, `MetricDataPoint`, `StreamEvent`, and `FeatureFlagKey` are defined once — no duplicated type definitions, no `any` at the API boundary. |
| **Request Deduplication** | TanStack Query's `queryKey` cache ensures that if multiple components mount with the same query key simultaneously, only one HTTP request fires. The metrics query, services list, and flags are all deduplicated automatically. |
| **Rate-Limited Stream** | All 20 per-tick `metric_update` WebSocket events in `useStream` are coalesced into a single `requestAnimationFrame` flush before reaching Zustand. Metric renders are capped at 60 fps regardless of server emission cadence. |

## API Reference

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/services` | List all 20 services with current status |
| GET | `/api/services/:id/metrics?from=&to=&resolution=` | Historical time-series |
| GET | `/api/alerts?status=&severity=&serviceId=&search=&page=&pageSize=` | Paginated alerts |
| PATCH | `/api/alerts/:id` | `{ status: "acknowledged" \| "resolved" }` |
| GET | `/api/dashboard/summary` | Aggregated stats |
| GET | `/api/flags` | All feature flags |
| GET | `/api/flags/:key` | Single flag value |
| PATCH | `/api/flags` | Override flags at runtime |
| WS | `/api/stream` | Real-time event stream |
| GET | `/health` | Server health check — returns uptime |

## Notes

- All data is in-memory; restarting the server resets metrics and alerts
- The simulation pre-fills 5 minutes of metric history per service on startup
- Alert cooldown prevents spam: same service+metric pair won't fire more than once per minute
- Runtime flag changes (`PATCH /api/flags` or the in-app gear panel) are persisted to `flags.json` and survive a server restart
